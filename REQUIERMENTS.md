# Frontend Task: POS UI and Product Thinking

**Celtis Australis – Frontend Engineer (UI Focus)**

---

## Overview

Build a **frontend-only POS interface** that focuses on:

- User flow
- UX quality
- UI clarity

You may start as small as **two inputs and one button**, then evolve it into a richer POS experience if you choose.

This is **not** a full-stack task.

### Constraints

- ❌ No backend
- ❌ No database
- ❌ No authentication

Mock data and **local storage** are more than enough.

> What we care about most is **how you think**, not how much you build.

---

## Scope and Expectations

POS is a large problem space, and **prior POS experience is not required**.

The goal is **not** to build a full POS system.  
The goal is to demonstrate:

- Product thinking
- UI clarity
- Flow design
- Practical decision-making

### Strong Preference

> **A small number of well thought-out, integrated features**  
> over  
> **A long list of partially implemented ones**

---

## What Matters Most

### User Journey

The user journey matters a lot:

- How flows connect
- How data is laid out
- How readable and calm the interface feels

### UI Details

Details matter:

- Font choice
- Sizing
- Spacing
- Alignment
- Information hierarchy

We are interested in how the UI would feel for **someone using it all day in a real store**.

---

## Inspiration (Not Requirements)

The following ideas are **optional inspiration**, not a checklist.

You are **not expected** to implement most (or even many) of them.

Possible areas to explore:

- Sales and invoices as separate flows
- Draft or parked sales
- Quotes with a lifecycle
- Refunds as states
- Basic sales history and filtering
- Delivery concepts
- Simple reporting
- Staff or session concepts

> Treat these as inspiration, not requirements.

---

## Tools and Technologies

You may use **any tools or frameworks** you’re comfortable with.

- React and TanStack are encouraged, but **not required**
- Choose what helps you work efficiently
- Focus on clearly demonstrating UI and product thinking

---

## Use of AI Tools

You **may use AI tools** while working on this task — we encourage it.

We are interested in:

- How you use AI as part of your workflow
- How it supports your thinking
- How you integrate it into your process

Using AI is **not** a negative signal.  
Using it **thoughtfully** is a positive one.

## What Makes a Submission Stand Out

Strong submissions often demonstrate clear product thinking, such as:

- Thinking in terms of **sale states**, not just screens
- Proposing a clean internal **data model**, even if fully mocked
- Considering **cashier ergonomics**:
  - Click count
  - Hotkeys
  - Flow speed
- Handling messy real-world scenarios:
  - Page refresh
  - Accidental navigation
  - Crashes or interrupted flows
- Showing empathy for **real store workflows**, not just visual polish

---

## Time Expectations

Please **do not treat this as a full-time assignment**.

- Expected effort: **a few focused hours**
- Deadline: **up to 5 days**
- Work at a comfortable pace around your commitments

> Spending more time does **not** increase your chances.  
> **Clarity and intent matter more than scope.**

---

## Submission Guidelines

Please reply to the email with:

- A link to a **public GitHub repository**
- A **live demo link**
- Any additional notes or documents you feel are relevant

### Repository Requirements

Include a short `README.md` covering:

- How to run the project locally
- Any assumptions you made
- A brief explanation of your approach and decisions  
  (bullet points are perfectly fine)

The repository does **not** need to be perfectly polished, but it should be:

- Clear
- Readable
- Easy to review

If something is intentionally simplified or left out, that’s fine — **just be explicit about it**.

---

## Final Note

Polish, clarity, and intent matter **more than feature count**.

We are not looking for perfection.  
We are looking for **good judgment**.
